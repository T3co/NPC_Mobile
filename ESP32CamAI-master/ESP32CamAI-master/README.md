## ESP32-Board

I configured my board as Tools/Board/ESP32 Wrover Module, and define CAMERA_MODEL_AI_THINKER for the pin definition. Because there are some different kind of ESP32-CAM modules, so please check your board and your pin definition respectively.

I clarified my module was trying to run the ESP32 example CameraWebserver first, then keep the setting for my other projects, but it maybe different from yours.
